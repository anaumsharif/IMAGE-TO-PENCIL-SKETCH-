# IMAGE-TO-PENCIL-SKETCH-

OpenCV is a great tool for image processing and performing computer vision tasks.
It is an open-source library that can be used to perform tasks like face detection, objection tracking, landmark detection, and much more.
An image is just a two-dimensional array of integers.
So one can do a couple of matrix manipulations using various python modules in order to get some very interesting effects.
In order to convert the normal image to a sketch, we will change its original RGB values and assign its RGB values similar to grey, in this way a sketch of the input image will be generated.
